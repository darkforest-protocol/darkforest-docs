# Introduction to DarkForest Protocol

Welcome to the official documentation for the **DarkForest Protocol** - a system that helps websites manage and redirect AI bot traffic.

## What is DarkForest Protocol?

DarkForest Protocol is a lightweight, easy-to-implement solution that helps website owners identify and control access from AI bots and crawlers. It provides a collective approach to managing how AI systems interact with your content.

The protocol works by detecting AI bot traffic through user agent patterns and redirecting them to a central message endpoint, allowing website owners to:

1. Identify which AI systems are accessing their content
2. Control access based on their preferences
3. Collect analytics about AI traffic
4. Participate in a collective network of websites with shared leverage

## Why Control AI Bot Access?

As AI systems increasingly crawl the web to train on content, website owners face several challenges:

- **Server Load**: High-volume AI crawling can increase server costs
- **Content Protection**: Preventing unauthorized training on proprietary content
- **Fair Compensation**: Ensuring value exchange for content used in AI training
- **Terms of Service**: Enforcing your site's terms regarding automated access
- **Collective Leverage**: Joining with other sites to establish industry standards

## Benefits of Joining DarkForest Protocol

By implementing DarkForest Protocol on your website, you gain:

- **Collective Leverage**: Join thousands of websites with a unified approach to AI traffic
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Understand which AI systems are accessing your content and how often
- **Centralized Messaging**: Communicate your terms to AI companies through a single channel
- **Simple Implementation**: Multiple integration options to fit any tech stack
- **Future-Proof**: Stay ahead of new AI crawlers with regularly updated bot patterns
