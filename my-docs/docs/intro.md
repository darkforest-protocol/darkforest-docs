# The Boundary

    > **Phase 1 of the DarkForest Protocol â€” Live Now**   

Welcome to the official documentation for **The Boundary**, the first active phase of the [DarkForest Protocol](https://darkfestforest.xyz).

## Draw Your Line in the Sand

The Boundary gives you immediate entry to the protocol in just a few methods. It redirects self-identifying AI crawlers to a clear, collective message: respect our boundaries and implement the protocol. 

## How it Works

The Boundary uses a simple yet powerful approach:

1. **Detect**: Identify AI bots through their user agent signatures
2. **Redirect**: Send them to our central API with your unique identifier
3. **Track**: Gain insights into which AI systems are accessing your content
4. **Strengthen**: Each implementation increases our collective leverage

This approach requires minimal resources while creating maximum impact through collective action.

## Why Join Now?

By implementing DarkForest Protocol on your website, you gain:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Access the network's shared analytics showing AI crawling patterns across all participating sites
- **Network Strength**: Join thousands of websites with a unified approach to AI traffic
- **Future-Ready**: Automatically benefit from Phase 2 (The Alliance) and Phase 3 (The Marketplace) as they launch
- **Multiple Integration Options**: Implementation methods for any tech stack
